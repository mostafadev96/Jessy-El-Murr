# Jessy-El-Murr
This website about jessy el murr and it's developed using laravel(php)

Starting with design for all pages of website.

Front-end and Back-end parallel with each other OR maybe Front-end will precedes.

Full Admin panel is deigned to edit or delete any content.

Added some ajax in (search item) to simplify content for the user and to reduce transactions.

All forms inputs are validated successfully including login form.

Added middleware so permitted admins only can use the dashboard and an change any content.

```
composer update
```
